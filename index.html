          <h3 class="pb-2">Background</h3>
          <p>
            Cheng Du Taste is a Sichuanese restaurant in Providence, Rhode Island. Customers can order from the
            restaurant on the website, or
            they can order by phone or third-party food delivery apps.
          </p>
          <p class="pb-3">
            I chose to redesign Cheng Du Taste's website because I found it hard to
            use last year, and ended up ordering from the restaurant using Uber Eats rather than the restaurant's
            website. I wanted to improve the
            design so that potential customers have a better experience using the site.
          </p>
          <p class="pb-3">
            The link to Cheng Du Taste's website can be found <a href="https://chengdutasteonline.com/">here</a>.

        </div>
        <div class="col-sm pl-5">
          <img src="original_chengdu.PNG" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image" />
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <h3 class="pb-2">Objective</h3>
    <p>
      My aim was to:
    <ul>
      <li>Analyze and identify flaws in the Cheng Du Taste website</li>
      <li>Create low-fidelity and high-fidelity prototypes for a variety of screen sizes</li>
      <li>Build a responsive website based on the prototypes</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h3 class="py-2">Identifying Usability Problems</h3>
    <h4 class="pb-2">Usability</h4>
    <p>I found many usability problems on the home page: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>There is no feedback when pressing buttons</li>
      <li>I often expect the button to close a modal to be on the top, but it is on the bottom</li>
      <li>On the mobile site, the modal covers the order online button, which can be annoying</li>
      <li>It's hard to read the modal since it's not completely opaque against the background, and has white text on a
        red background</li>
      <li>The map doesn't show where the restaurant is, since there is no pin for the location</li>
      <li>When you hover over some of the photos, the label just says "Photo"</li>
      <li>Having three separate pages is unnecessary; the content on the gallery and directions page is already on the
        home page</li>
    </ul>
    <h4 class="pb-2">Accessibility</h4>
    <p>I used WebAIM WAVE to detect potential accessibility problems on the current website. These were the
      accessibility problems that it found:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The website has very little alt text for images, even though the site itself has a lot of image content</li>
      <li>There is very low contrast between the text and background</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Generally, I agreed with the problems detected. Alternative text and sufficient contrast are very important
      to make websites accessible, especially for viewers who may use screen readers and/or have limited eyesight.
    </p>
    <h3 class="py-2">Visual Redesign</h3>
    <h4 class="pb-2">Low Fidelity Prototypes</h4>
    <p>I used Balsamiq to create 3 wireframes for each type screen size (mobile, tablet, and desktop). For the
      low-fidelity prototypes, I wanted
      to focus on the usability problems that I found. The major changes that I made were:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Making website to be a single page website rather than multi page.</strong> This optimizes the
        experience for mobile users who are used to scrolling, and minimizes repeated information.</li>
      <li><strong>Making the navbar fixed at the top, where selecting the link scrolls to the corresponding page
          position.</strong> This allows users, especially those on a laptop, to navigate the page smoothly.</li>
      <li><strong>Adding labels to the images in the image gallery.</strong> This allows users to learn what dish each
        image shows.</li>
      <li><strong>Putting the important information, like the phone number and address on the splash page.</strong>
        Users should not have to scroll to find important information.</li>
      <li><strong>Fixing the embedded map to show the restaurant location correctly.</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <div class="container">
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-12">
          <img class="img-fluid" alt="responsive low fidelity prototype" src="responsive_lofi.png" />
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <h4 class="pb-2">Style Guide</h4>
    <p>I created a visual design style guide to show the colors, typography, and reusable component states.</p>
    <div class="container">
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-8">
          <img class="img-fluid" alt="responsive style guide" src="responsive_style_guide.png" />
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <h4 class="pb-2">High Fidelity Prototypes</h4>
    <p>Next, I created high fidelity prototypes for each screen size. The flexbox, padding, margins, and components like
      buttons and the navbar were mostly
      configured using Bootstrap classes. The documentation for Bootstrap can be found <a
        href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/getting-started/introduction/">here</a>.
    </p>
    <div class="container pb-2">
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-sm-6 col-lg-6 pb-2">
          <h5 class="text-center fw-bold pt-4">Web</h5>
          <img class="img-fluid" src="responsive_web.png" />
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-6 col-lg-4 pb-2 fw-bold">
          <h5 class="text-center fw-bold pt-4">Tablet</h5>
          <img class="img-fluid" src="responsive_tablet.png" />
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-6 col-lg-2 pb-2 fw-bold">
          <h5 class="text-center fw-bold pt-4">Phone</h5>
          <img class="img-fluid" src="responsive_mobile.png" />
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <h3 class="py-2">Responsive Redesign</h3>
    <p>Finally, I created the page using HTML and CSS. The website follows the high fidelity prototypes to ensure that
      the website is usable and accessible. All images have alt text, and the navbar has aria labels. </p>
    <p>The URL to the page is <a
        href="https://unemployedpangolin015.github.io/responsive-redesign/">https://unemployedpangolin015.github.io/responsive-redesign/</a>.
      The page has also been embedded below:</p>
    <div class="container">
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-8 bg-primary p-1">
          <div class="ratio ratio-1x1">
            <a href="https://unemployedpangolin015.github.io/responsive-redesign/"
              class="text-white bg-dark p-2">Embedded page didn't load :'(. Click this link to view the page instead:
